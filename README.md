# Contrastive Prediction of Point Process Observations (C3PO)

Unsupervised model to infer latent generative processes from point processes occuring in $\mathbb{R}^d$ spcae. Developed with focus for inferring neural states from waveform features of
unclustered spike events.

## Derivation


## Similar Methods

- Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC)
  - Works for continuous time rather than point processes
- Temporal Neural Networks (e.g. Hawkes process)
  - designed for categorically labeled events
- CEBRA
  - designed for sorted spiking data
  - semi-supervised definition of matching states
